FREE NET

Free-Net is a project that enables users to scan public or private networks to find and connect to available internet access points. Once connected, it saves the SSID information and continues scanning for additional networks without interrupting the current connection. Additionally, Free-Net can share the connection through a hotspot, acting as a relay to provide free internet access for you or your network.
